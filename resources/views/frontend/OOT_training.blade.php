                                <p>Out of Trend (OOT) events play a significant role in quality control and process
                                    management within the life sciences industry. An OOT event occurs when data points
                                    deviate from an expected pattern or trend, indicating a variation that could
                                    potentially impact product quality or process performance if left unaddressed.
                                    Unlike out-of-specification (OOS)
                                </p>
                                <p>OOT deviations represent unusual fluctuations that require attention. However, it is
                                    important to note that OOT events still require compliance with regulatory standards
                                    such as 21 CFR Part 211 and 820 in order to investigate and resolve their potential
                                    causes effectively.

                                                <p>
                                                    Once an OOT event is detected, a thorough investigation becomes
                                                    critical to maintaining compliance and confidence in life science
                                                    operations. The investigation typically involves several key steps.
                                                    First and foremost, is performing a root cause analysis study to
                                                    establish the causes of variation.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Variability in process, equipment, environment, or operations may
                                                    contribute to the OOT event. Therefore, any process modifications
                                                    made recently should be thoroughly assessed. Uncontrolled process or
                                                    product changes often generate unexpected variations that mimic OOT
                                                    or OOS results. Establishing control over all changes is key to
                                                    avoiding false signals.</p>

                                                    Detecting an OOT event often relies on various statistical methods,

                                                    implications. Most commonly used statistical tools for detecting an
                                                    OOT event include Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts.

                                                <p>
                                                    The SPC charts are effective tools for monitoring data over time and
                                                    establishing an expected range of variability. Points outside the
                                                    control limits on the chart indicate an OOT signal. Control charts
                                                    play a crucial role in detecting changes in the process that could
