                                <p>The SAP system setup for Pharmaceutical companies is same as any other
                                    industries/organizations; just Pharma companies are regulated by special Government
                                    bodies by the state.
                                </p>
                                <p>This is because Pharma companies manufacture medicines and other products which are
                                    essential for maintaining good human life and hence are sensitive entities. To
                                    launch any new pharmaceutical product in the market, it has to be rigorously tested
                                    and test results documented and are verified by the regulating bodies. </p>

                                                <p>GAP here means incompleteness or missing links. GAP analysis means
                                                    analyzing the SAP system through available documentation, and
                                                    current status of SAP with reference to the guidelines of Regulatory
                                                    agencies and attempt to find out from available implemented systems.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>A gap analysis can be arranged on short notice. Depending on the

                                                    to assess whether the pharmacy is meeting the standards and that the
