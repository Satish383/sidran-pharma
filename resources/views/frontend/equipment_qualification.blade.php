                                <p>It is a basic requirement of good analytical chemistry that
                                    balances and other analytical instruments must be suitable
                                    for the purpose for which they are used and that they must
                                    be appropriately calibrated. As a consequence, Equipment
                                    Qualification is gaining more and more importance in
                                    ensuring the validity of results.
                                </p>
                                <p>Regulatory bodies also seem to be turning their attention increasingly to this area,
                                    and manufacturers of analytical equipment are forced to play a significant role in
                                    the various steps of Equipment Qualification.</p>
