                                <h3>Importance of Investigation Training</h3>
                                <p>Investigations are essential to identify, analyze, and resolve deviations,
                                    non-conformances, and complaints in the pharmaceutical manufacturing process. Proper
                                    training ensures that employees understand the importance of investigations in
                                    maintaining product quality and safety standards.
                                </p>
                                <p>The most common regulatory concern is that investigations fail to thoroughly conduct
                                    root cause analysis (RCA) and fail to link corrective and preventative actions to
                                    the root causes identified. Often companies are cited for not considering the
                                    potential magnitude of an event or not considering other batches previously produced
                                    and possibly released into the market.

                                                    manufacturing processes. Training programs should focus on
