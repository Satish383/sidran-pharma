                                    validation verifies that the cleaning procedure can consistently and significantly

                                                <p>During the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, the surface of the
                                                    equipment comes in direct contact with therapeutic active
                                                    ingredients and many excipients used in the formulation. Also,
                                                    during cleaning and sanitizing, the equipment surface is treated
                                                    with water and various cleaning agents.
                                                </p>

                                                    if not removed properly during the cleaning process may cause
                                                    harmful contamination to the next product. By doing so it ensures

                                                    first thing you need is to devise a plan. Preparation of a cleaning
                                                    validation protocol is the first step of planning.

                                                <p>Typically, in a protocol you will include a clear and specific
                                                    objective. Followed by the collection or grouping of equipment that
                                                    will be covered by the protocol. If you must adopt a protocol
                                                    change, include the protocol change management approach.</p>
