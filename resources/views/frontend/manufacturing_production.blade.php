                                <p>
                                    Pharmaceutical manufacturers are under continuous pressure to remain competitive
                                    while meeting the stringent regulatory manufacturing requirements. These
                                    manufacturing requirements range from simple electronic record keeping to complex
                                    data assuring consistently the reliability of the manufacturing processes, equipment
                                    and people’s training, raw material quality, sampling plans, root-cause-analysis,
                                    product’s deviations, etc. Atachi Systems’ experience in deploying MES for
                                    pharmaceutical manufacturing companies for several years in a row is a testimonial
                                    on its own. Put simply, Atachi Systems understands the importance of deploying an
                                    MES system that is strategic to its core manufacturing requirements, yet cost
                                    effective to maintain and run for years to come! Our clients call it the Atachi
                                    Advantage.

                                                <p>In this context, Atachi Systems will share the importance of
                                                    eLogbooks for pharmaceutical manufacturing. If you look at the
                                                    Indian pharma industry, many pharma manufacturing companies still
                                                    use paper-based logbooks and records. These companies face a lot of
                                                    challenges and compliance issues in the paper-based logbooks. </p>
