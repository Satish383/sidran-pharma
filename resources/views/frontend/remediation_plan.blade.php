                                <p>Quality problems are rising in the pharmaceutical industry, often to the point of
                                    crisis. But remediation is no simple matter. If not handled effectively, it can be
                                    extremely cumbersome and expensive, often without even fully meeting its main goal:
                                    reducing patient risk.
                                </p>
                                <p>It’s time for companies to devote more attention to effective remediation
                                    initiatives. Empirical evidence demonstrates that an intensive investment early on,
                                    following a structured approach to problem solving and project management, can make
                                    remediation run much more smoothly.</p>
